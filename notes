Ripple Effect - house prices firstly move in Ldn, rest of the country follows.
Testing for a unilateral relationship
Will get 1 location and 2 random variables. 
house prices 
monthly data
You can copy regression output for the assignment

Step 1  - Looking at individual variables in log form - Determining whether they are trend stationary or different stationary. 
Order integration only applies to different stationary

gen t4=tq(1983q1)+_n-1
format t4 %tq
tsset t4
twoway (tsline ea lon), ytitle(House Prices in London and East Anglia) ttitle(Month) title(House Prices in London and East Anglia from 1Q1983 to 2Q2015)
gen lnea = log(ea)
gen lnlon = log(lon)

Schwert formula
display 12*(n/100)^0.25
n = number of observation

Start with those number of lags

Next decision - 
Constant term, no trend
Trend and no constant
Neither

Loops - Don't get extra marks

Introuduce topic - Why it's important
Information about 2 series. 

Briefing point - Series of bullet points - Capture everything you have done - This is what we have found in terms of stationarity, cointegration etc. 
Half a dozen bullet points

coefficient l1
t - Choose significance level - flexible but not overly restrictive
east anglia - non stationary - couldnt reject the null at the 5% level
How do you choose significance level
Lonodn - cant reject 5% level - 4.137 more negative - can reject null hypothesis - stationary - because result suggests its tren
Looking at variable 
Trend term in model - can reject null hypothesis - suggest it's a trend series. 


You can make assumptions - 

Stationarity test on residuals - detrended

You can state 'there appears to be evidence for london - trend stationary' , east anglia - 'different stationary' 
Despite this, can assume both different stationary 
Can do both to see if results are sensitive to the decision. 
look in levels form
First difference, not a trend 
Until last lag becomes significant

Different stationary - Plot london first diffeence - look to see if trend
reset - look at plot each time
Look at how close the test statistic is to 5% - 

2nd difference - d2 - differenced twice to make stationary
Sensitivity analysis 
1% level - both series are i2


Presentation of the results >> 
Top - write associated equation, and hypothesis you are testing
For each output - equation
Condensed table - what we found- levels form (intercept and trend\), intercept only (levels, first difference , seocnd difference)

structure of briefing paper / hints and tricks of data
i1 - stronger evidence i2 if assuming different stationary. - Change structure of granger causality test. 

Same - Add-in stata
Installer

Order of integration
As a reference point - whether the difference 
1) Go to original regression in levels form, get residuals from model
2) Test for stationarity on residuals - Is the difference in time similar? 
egranger 

value less - Can't reject - Residuals are non-stationary - not cointegrated rules out error correction models (ECM)
Only decision - optimum number of lags - reset 

Granger Causality
2 sets of variables when deciding the lag legnth
Until the last lag of either is significant (least restrictive)
Test until 1 is significant, continue to test on the other
Test until both is significant (most restrictive)
Test - Robustness Sensitivity Analysis

Decision of all data, or subsets of data
full sample - everything appropriately - good
exceptional - robustness
Looking at different decisions on choosing lag length
How you're using data

Logic behind this, timeframe
1995 - 2024

Background - Why topic is important
2 regions you're looking - what the hypothesis might be 

Granger Causality
i1 -test with 13 lags
How can we tell which variable against each other - 2 equations
One with one way, then the other way
Drop lags until it becomes significant. 
(refer to line 89)

significance level the entire time - Ftest
Once decided lag length - testparm - looking at whether lag values of london influence east anglia
Flip it over for the reverse F test 
Past values of east anglia on current values of london - Cant reject the null  - 

Swap as dependent variable on explanatory vairbale
Lag variable - explanatory
Dependent - current prices. 

Ripple Effect -based on X , we might think Y#


Briefing paper

Using this to introduce topic - What are you going to investigate
Why is this important? Why should we care - Say something about 2 regions - size, located, geographical positioning - wikipedia - set up potential hypothesis

Grouped together
Proximity
One's bigger than the other 

Very different size - 
Bigger, smaller - unidirectional - flow from one to the other rather than the other
Population flow between
